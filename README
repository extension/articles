== Welcome to Darmok

Darmok is an extension.org developed project that provides a common codebase for our public site (www.extension.org), identity management (people.extension.org), and Ask an Expert (aae.extension.org) applications.

Darmok migrations depend on having access to the original database.  There is no way currently to bootstrap a new install of this application.
