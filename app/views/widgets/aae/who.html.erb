<h2>Who answers the questions?</h2>

<p>Questions are answered by Cooperative Extension agents, staff and professionals from around the country who have volunteered to work in the eXtension Ask an Expert system.</p>

<h3>Here's what happens to a question</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A question is submitted from an Ask eXtension widget</li>
    <li>The question shows up in the <%= link_to "Incoming Question list", incoming_url %> <em>(eXtensionID required)</em></li>
    <li>The question is automatically assigned to an Extension agent based on the question's location. If there's not a location match, the question is assigned to Question Wranglers who have volunteered to handle and route orphaned questions. An email is sent to the agent when a question is assigned.</li>
    <li>If able, the agent answers the question and the response is emailed to the user who submitted the question. Otherwise the question can be assigned to someone else.</li>
</ol>
