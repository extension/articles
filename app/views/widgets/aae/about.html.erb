<h2>About the Ask an Expert Widget</h2>

<p><img alt="the Ask Extension widget" src="/images/ask/ask-widget-small.png" /></p> 

<p>The widget enables groups working with Cooperative Extension including county offices to manage and answer questions asked by their clientele. The widget works in conjunction with the eXtension Ask an Expert system.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<div>
    <h4>Using the Ask eXtension Widget</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the widget</li>
        <li>Accept questions at your site</li>
        <li class="last">Answer using the <em>Ask an Expert</em> System</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>Groups involved with Cooperative Extension place the Ask eXtension widget on their Extension-related site. When someone submits a question, it's routed to experts and Extension agents in the Ask an Expert application who respond to the question submitter from there.</p>
