AtomServices
============

This plugin was designed to allow for the generation of atom feeds within applications.
It is initially planned to be used for both the faq and events applications within eXtension to deliver data from
these applications in an atom feed for qualifying external applications that have a need/desire to access this
data. 
NOTE: This plugin was originally based on the resource_feeder ruby on rails plugin
that can be found here: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/plugins/resource_feeder
