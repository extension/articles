Third Party Libraries and Code
=============================

Where applicable, certain libraries or code snippets will be available under 
less restrictive terms, including the BSD/MIT source code licenses, we've 
tried to exercise due diligence in indicating third-party code libraries that
are not subject to the same terms as the NC State University/eXtension code, but
it's possible that we have missed some items. 

For partners in good standing with the rights to use this code by eXtension's
Terms of Use, you must conduct a audit of the code for all applicable licensing
terms before making use of the code under the Terms of Use. 

NC State University, eXtension, and the code contributors are not liable for 
oversights made in the inclusion of code not subject to the eXtension Terms 
of Use, and by using this code, you agree to hold harmless all aforementioned
parties for any oversights in the use of third-party libraries and code.
